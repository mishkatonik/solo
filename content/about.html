    					<p class="about">
    						Star Trek has been a cultural phenomenon since it first aired in 1963. Among it many alluring qualities, the show had a knack for its nuanced depiction of the various alien races encountered, and all of the culture shock that comes with such close encounters. As the series progressed and we got to know these strange aliens better and better, we also got to enjoy their vast variety of cuisine. 
    					<br/><br/>
    						Star Trek has never shied away from an opportunity to show off its food special effects. Veritable boutines of eveything from <em>rokeg</em> blood pie and <em>gagh</em>, to Gyronian meat loaf and Senarian egg broth strewn across a holodeck dinner table tantalize the senses. But where can a simple Earthbound human get fresh Bajoran mussels this time of year?
                        <br/><br/>
                            Lucky for you and I, with just a couple inventive substitutions you too can enjoy the unique bite of spiny lobe-fish grilled over an open flame, or the sweet-sour undertones of a Trikalian Sunrise on the beach.
